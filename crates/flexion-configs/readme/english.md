English inflection for **any** English word, attested or not: noun plurals,
verb forms, comparatives and superlatives, each with how sure the grammar is
and why.

```rust
use english::*;

assert_eq!(noun("cat", Number::Plural), "cats");
assert_eq!(noun("child", Number::Plural), "children");
assert_eq!(verb("go", VerbForm::Past), "went");
assert_eq!(adjective("good", Degree::Comparative), "better");
```

A word nobody wrote down inflects by the rules learned from the words that
were. Every answer can come with its alternatives, how likely each is, and why:

```rust
use english::*;

let plurals = Noun::new("glorp").candidates(Number::Plural);
assert_eq!(plurals[0].form, "glorps");
println!("{}", plurals[0]);
```

Agreement, pronouns and possessives are hand-written helpers on top:

```rust
use english::*;

assert_eq!(conjugate("be", Tense::Present, Person::First, Number::Singular), "am");
assert_eq!(conjugate("walk", Tense::Present, Person::Third, Number::Singular), "walks");
assert_eq!(pronoun(Person::Third, Number::Singular, Gender::Feminine, Case::Accusative), "her");
assert_eq!(count_with_number("mouse", 3), "3 mice");
assert_eq!(add_possessive("dogs"), "dogs'");
```

The personal pronouns are a fixed table written by hand (`pronoun`): the
dictionary's head lines give only some of their forms (`he` lists `himself`
and not `him`), so a grammar learned from them would guess the rest.
