Sanskrit inflection for **any** word, attested or not, in Devanagari: nouns and
adjectives in eight cases and three numbers, and verbs (present system with its
four moods, imperfect, future, conditional, perfect, aorist, infinitive,
gerund, participles), each with how sure the grammar is and why.

```rust
use sanskrit::*;

assert_eq!(noun("देव", Case::Instrumental, Number::Singular), "देवेन");
assert_eq!(noun("देव", Case::Genitive, Number::Plural), "देवानाम्");
assert_eq!(adjective("नव", Case::Nominative, Gender::Feminine, Number::Singular), "नवा");

// A noun the dictionary lacks: by its ending masculine, unless you say otherwise.
assert_eq!(noun("सुकुल", Case::Nominative, Number::Singular), "सुकुलः");
let neuter = Noun::new("सुकुल").gender(Gender::Neuter);
assert_eq!(neuter.form((Case::Nominative, Number::Singular)), "सुकुलम्");
```

Nouns and adjectives are cited by their stem, as Sanskrit dictionaries do;
verbs by the third person singular present. The forms are Classical (Vedic
variants and accents are left out), with the sandhi inside the word.
