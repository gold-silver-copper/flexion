# italian

Italian inflection for **any** Italian word, attested or not: noun plurals,
adjective and participle agreement, and the whole simple conjugation
(indicative, subjunctive, imperative, gerund, participles), each with how sure
the grammar is and why.

```rust
use italian::*;

assert_eq!(noun("uomo", Number::Plural), "uomini");
assert_eq!(noun("città", Number::Plural), "città");
assert_eq!(adjective("bello", Gender::Feminine, Number::Plural), "belle");
assert_eq!(verb("finire", Tense::Present, Person::First, Number::Singular), "finisco");
assert_eq!(verb("prendere", Tense::PastHistoric, Person::First, Number::Singular), "presi");
assert_eq!(agreeing_participle("scrivere", Gender::Feminine, Number::Singular), "scritta");
assert_eq!(before_noun("bello", Gender::Masculine, Number::Plural, "occhi").as_deref(), Some("begli"));
```

Forms are written in standard spelling, with an accent only on a final
stressed vowel (`città`, `prenderò`) and on the monosyllables that take one
(`dà`, `può`).

## How it works

This crate is Italian inflection as a grammar, learned by
[flexion](https://github.com/gold-silver-copper/flexion) from the English Wiktionary's
Italian entries. Each part of speech is a module under `src/`, and has what its
grammar needs of:

- `paradigms.rs`: how words inflect, one table per paradigm, named after a word that
  follows it, with a pattern per form (`~а`: the stem, then `а`; `referred`: another
  cell's form, as the word's feature says);
- `rules.rs`: which paradigm a word takes, as rules on its ending, each with how many of
  the dictionary's words with that ending follow each paradigm, and the words no rule
  gets right, listed;
- `accent.rs`: per cell, which rule places the accent, and which words have which
  pattern;
- `prefixes.rs`: prefixes a word inflects behind, separable or not;
- `compounds.rs`: whether a word written in parts inflects each part;
- `marks.rs` and `spellings.rs`: how a word typed without its marks (vowel length,
  `ё`) is spelled;
- `irregular.rs`: the forms no paradigm gives;
- a module per principal part, where a part of speech is built on them: each cell
  belongs to one part's system and is inflected from that part.

A word the dictionary lists gets its own forms. Any other word gets the paradigm its
ending suggests, with a probability that says how often such a guess is right, and the
reason (the rule and its counts).

## The grammar

| | words | systems | paradigms | rules | listed words | irregular forms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| noun | 61772 | 1 | 28 | 896 | 2213 | 124 |
| adjective | 26291 | 3 | 21 | 541 | 923 | 25 |
| verb | 12955 | 1 | 143 | 385 | 509 | 2087 |
| participle | 8087 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 3 |
| determiner | 44 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 6 | 5 |

*Words*: the dictionary's words the grammar is learned from. *Systems*: the principal
parts a part of speech is built on (1: its lemma alone). *Rules*: the endings that
choose a paradigm. *Listed words*: words no rule gets right, listed with their paradigm.
*Irregular forms*: forms no paradigm gives, listed.

## How well it does

A tenth of the words (by a hash of the word) was held out: the grammar scored here was
learned from the other nine tenths, and asked for every form the dictionary lists of
each held-out word, typed as the dictionary's headword. *Top-1*: its first answer is
right; *top-3*: the right answer is among its first three. *Calibration error*: how far
its stated probabilities are, on average, from how often it is right (0 is perfect).
*Top-1, lemma in full*: typed with every mark the dictionary's table writes, and said
to be so (`spelled_in_full`).

| | held-out words | forms | top-1 | top-3 | calibration error | top-1, lemma in full |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| noun | 6392 | 12784 | **97.93%** | 99.72% | 0.002 | 97.93% |
| adjective | 2632 | 10535 | **98.85%** | 99.95% | 0.003 | 98.85% |
| verb | 1286 | 71586 | **98.82%** | 99.62% | 0.005 | 98.82% |
| participle | 821 | 3284 | **100.00%** | 100.00% | 0.000 | 100.00% |
| determiner | 7 | 26 | **96.15%** | 100.00% | 0.038 | 96.15% |
