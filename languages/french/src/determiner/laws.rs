//! Sound laws where a stem meets its ending (`+`), where a form's first
//! literal meets the stem (`‹`: the augment `ἐ‹ἀ → ἠ`), on a letter a
//! `%` copies (`°`), on a class letter an ending writes (harmony, by the
//! nearest letter of a tier before it as written), or inside a stem that
//! alternates (`ˇ`, by what follows it): every form a declension builds
//! goes through them, in order, so one declension serves words whose stems change
//! its endings. Each with the words whose forms it gives, and how many of
//! the dictionary's forms it gets wrong (those are listed in `irregular.rs`).
