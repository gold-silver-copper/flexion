# spanish

Spanish inflection for **any** Spanish word, attested or not: noun plurals,
adjective agreement, and the whole conjugation (every simple tense, both
imperfect subjunctives, voseo, imperatives, participles), each with how sure
the grammar is and why.

```rust
use spanish::*;

assert_eq!(noun("canción", Number::Plural), "canciones");
assert_eq!(noun("joven", Number::Plural), "jóvenes");
assert_eq!(adjective("feliz", Gender::Feminine, Number::Plural), "felices");
assert_eq!(verb("contar", Tense::Present, Person::First, Number::Singular), "cuento");
assert_eq!(verb("hacer", Tense::Preterite, Person::First, Number::Singular), "hice");
assert_eq!(vos("tener", Mood::Indicative), "tenés");
assert_eq!(participle("escribir", Gender::Feminine, Number::Plural), "escritas");
```

Written accents are part of the word: `papá` and `papa` are two words.

## How it works

This crate is Spanish inflection as a grammar, learned by
[flexion](https://github.com/gold-silver-copper/flexion) from the English Wiktionary's and the Spanish Wiktionary's
Spanish entries. Each part of speech is a module under `src/`, and has what its
grammar needs of:

- `paradigms.rs`: how words inflect, one table per paradigm, named after a word that
  follows it, with a pattern per form (`~`: the stem, then what follows it;
  `derived`: another cell's form, changed);
- `relations.rs`: which cell each cell's form is told from, and the rules on that
  form's ending that change it;
- `laws.rs`: sound laws where a stem meets its ending or a literal before it (along a
  tier, on a copied letter, or on a class letter an ending writes: harmony), each
  with the words whose forms it gives and the forms it gets wrong;
- `rules.rs`: which paradigm a word takes, as rules on its ending, each with how many
  of the dictionary's words with that ending follow each paradigm, and the words no
  rule gets right, listed;
- `spellings.rs`: the words whose spelling their typed form doesn't show;
- `stems.rs`: the stem slots (the cells a word builds on one stem, learned from the
  words that put different stems in different cells) and the ending tables paradigms
  share over a slot, each named after its commonest word;
- `irregular.rs`: what no paradigm gives a word: the stem it lists for a slot, built
  with an ending table, and the forms no stem gives.

A word the dictionary lists gets its own forms. Any other word gets the paradigm its
ending suggests, with a probability that says how often such a guess is right, and the
reason (the rule and its counts).

## The grammar

| | words | paradigms | sound laws | rules | listed words | irregular forms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| noun | 60268 | 21 | 0 | 288 | 741 | 76 |
| adjective | 24552 | 22 | 15 | 246 | 516 | 61 |
| verb | 17975 | 159 | 21 | 1095 | 875 | 418 |
| determiner | 60 | 6 | 0 | 10 | 18 | 14 |

*Words*: the dictionary's words the grammar is learned from. *Sound laws*: changes
where a stem meets its ending (or farther, along a tier). *Rules*: the endings that
choose a paradigm. *Listed words*: words no rule gets right, listed with their paradigm.
*Irregular forms*: forms no paradigm gives, listed.

## How well it does

A tenth of the words (by a hash of the word) was held out: the grammar scored here was
learned from the other nine tenths, and asked for every form the dictionary lists of
each held-out word, typed as the dictionary's headword. *Top-1*: its first answer is
right; *top-3*: the right answer is among its first three. *Calibration error*: how far
its stated probabilities are, on average, from how often it is right (0 is perfect).
The margin after top-1 is a 95% interval, counting words. *Lemma in full*: top-1 typed
with every mark the dictionary's table writes, and said to be so (`spelled_in_full`).
*Principal parts given*: top-1 of the other forms, given the dictionary's principal
parts. *Features given*: top-1 from the headword, told the word's inherent features
(its gender, as `.gender(…)` tells it). *Among the candidates*: the right answer is
among its answers at all. *Every cell right*: the share of words with every form right.
*Log loss*: bits per form, −log₂ of the probability it gives the right answer (a form
it doesn't give costs 5 bits a letter). *1 / 2 / 3 forms given*: top-1 of the other
forms, typed in full, given that many of the word's forms chosen at random.
*Seen* and *unseen cells*: top-1 on the cells some training word of the word's
paradigm has a form in, and on the others, derived
from other cells (with the number of forms). *Floor*: the CoNLL–SIGMORPHON 2017
shared task's non-neural baseline (letters only), and on the unseen cells. *Attested*: top-1 of the shipped
grammar on the dictionary's own words, typed in full.
