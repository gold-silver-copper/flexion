//! Which declension a word takes. The rule with the longest ending the word has
//! decides (`#` is the word's start: `#lux` is the word `lux`), giving each
//! declension with how many of the dictionary's words with that ending follow it; the words no rule gets right are listed. A rule is
//! kept only when it pays for itself: it must describe the words it covers
//! in fewer bits than the broader rule does, by more than the rule costs.
