//! The declensions, commonest first, each named after a word that follows it.
//!
//! A pattern is the form with `~` where the stem goes: `~а` is the stem and
//! `а`; a stem in two pieces, `~о~`, has a vowel between them that other
//! forms drop. Alternatives are separated by `|`, the usual one first. A `%`
//! is the first letter of the stem piece after it (reduplication: `%ε~κα`),
//! as the copy laws in `laws.rs` change it. A `ˇ` ends
//! the patterns of a declension whose stems alternate: the laws in `laws.rs`
//! for alternating stems change them (`~nˇ`: `katu`, `kadun`).
